# Wheel of Things to Do

A wheel for when I want to do something and am not sure what, that also tracks stats because I am not immune from number-go-up.

Uses [Spin Wheel](https://github.com/CrazyTim/spin-wheel?tab=readme-ov-file) and a hint of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) because I refuse to learn vanilla JS DOM manipulation.

Also uses a frankly chaotic script system that scatters global variables across JS files like candy rather than module imports because I don't want to have to set up a server to run this each time because I will not use it if I do, which rather defeats the purpose.
